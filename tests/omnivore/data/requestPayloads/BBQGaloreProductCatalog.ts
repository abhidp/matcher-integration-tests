Japanese for 'stove', the <strong>Dragon Kamado barbeque can barbeque, smoke, grill, bake, and roast</strong>, and uses charcoal or Heat beads(TM) to cook. With its insulated, double-skin construction, the Dragon Kamado's high-temp painted steel outer body finish is <strong>touch-safe </strong>so it's safe to be used around kids. The Dragon Kamado also comes with a trolley which features <strong>side shelves </strong>and a bottom shelf for <strong>extra storage.</strong></p> <p>The <strong>adjustable vent </strong>in the top hat of the Dragon Kamado allows for airflow control, and therefore cooking temperature control. Keeping a close eye on the cooking temperature is easy thanks to the built-in temperature gauge. High heats can be achieved and held inside the kettle for high temperature grilling, or drop the temperature for sustained slow cooking. You can even use a wok with the Dragon Kamado. The firebox is constructed of vitreous enamelled steel, and the<strong> included warming rack</strong> is chrome plated steel. A <strong>removable ash collector </strong>makes cleaning out your Dragon Kamado quick and easy.</p>",
